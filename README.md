## Objectives
- As a User (A.A.U), I would like there to be at least two different time-length options.
- I would like to see a new relaxing image automatically each time open the app.
- When I press the start button I would like for there to be a quote, something inspirtational or spiritual, for me to think about while I meditate.
- When I start the timer, the clock should begin to tick down and I should hear the calming sounds of an ocean. The ticker should stop at zero and make a 'Ding' when it stops, alerting me that the meditation is over. 
- I should be able to press a button to easily reset the timer and start again if I so choose. 


## Motivation
- To provide a simple, free service for people looking to explore meditation, to practice on-the-go, or as a sleep aid. 

- To help people manage their anxiety, relieve stress, and decompress in small, easily-digestable does. 

- Avoid disruptive advertisements from youtube mid-practice.

- Free, unlimited access from anywhere with internet connection.
